# GeneratingShortlink

This project is about URL shortening where given a long URL (link) then it generates a short URL (short link) version of it.


The generated short URL redirected to the long  URL site once it is clicked.

//   Before  generating the Url, ( validation is done  to confirm if the URL is valid or not. url cannot be generated in the instances where the URL is not valid.)
